		A rubber tree plant is also known as a Ficus elastica. These large trees can grow up to 50 feet (15 m.) tall. When learning how to care for a rubber tree plant, there are a few key things to remember, but rubber plant care isn’t as difficult as one might think. Starting with a young rubber tree houseplant will allow it to adapt to being an indoor plant better than starting with a more mature plant. Proper Light and Water for a Rubber Tree Plant When it comes to rubber plant care, the correct balance of water and light is crucial, as with any plant.  During the growing season, it needs to be kept moist and watered at least once a week. It is also a good idea to wipe off the leaves of your rubber tree houseplant with a damp cloth or spritz them with water. If you water the rubber tree plant too much, it will signal you by the leaves turning yellow and brown and falling off.
